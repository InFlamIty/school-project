            <br><br><br><br>
            <h2 id="vidC">We followed this video guide on how to make coin battery. So if you don't want to read, you can watch the video. link | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIHfUJu3aKo</h2>
            <br>
            <h3 id="buildC">So, if your still here, here are the following steps we took to make the coin battery</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 id="stepsC">1. we got 10 pennies and soaked them in a mix of distilled vinegar and some salt for about a minute
                <br>
                2. we dried the coins and used 1 to create 10 identical circles in thin cardboard and cut the circles out
                <br>
                3. once we finished cutting out all the cardboard circles, we repeated step 2 but on tin foil
                <br>
                4. we repeated step 1 but with the cardboard and we left it there until we started building
                <br>
                Now that we are done all of that we started to actually build the battery.
                <br>
                5. first we got a penny and placed it down on a flat surface
                <br>
                6. after that we put down a cardboard circle on the penny
                <br>
                7. then we placed a tin foil cirlce on the cardboard circle
                <br>
                8. we repeated steps 5, 6, and 7 until we ran out of pennies
                <br>
                9. once we finished that we connect a wire to the top and the bottom
                <br>
                10. after we placed the wires we taped the entire thing together
                <br><br>
                And finally we finished the battery, all we have to do now is connect the wires to something like a light or a buzzer and it will work!
